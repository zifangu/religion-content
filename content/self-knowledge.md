title: SELF-KNOWLEDGE

## Moment 1
Throughout the semester, I found out how my background was drastically different than everyone else. This was achieved by comparing myself to others. One of the roll call topics, which I still think is our best topic, is to “say something others would not know about you.” One of our classmates said that she is a contracted Disney Plus and Amazon actress. When I heard about it, my first reaction was “nice! Good for her!” While the rest of the class were more along the lines of “That is so cool! It’s crazy.” This made me realize that to most people, actresses and celebrities are distant figures. It just so happens that my personal experience has made me come in contact with many of the supposed distant figures.
I went to high school with Myles Moore, who plays Jake Maitland in the music drama tv series named *Nashville*. This is a picture of us in the same prom group. ![prom Myles](https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/myles_prom.png)

Like Myles, another celebrity that went to my school is Zion Williamson, who is currently a power forward for the New Orleans Pelicans. This is a picture of the majority of our senior graduating class during the state championship (can you spot me?). ![zion game](https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/zion_game.png)

## Moment 2
On March 23, a Panama flagged, Japanese-owned cargo ship Ever Given was grounded in the waterway of the Suez Canal. This blockage caused a major disruption in world trade. However terrible the event is, when I first heard about the incident, my first reaction was “imagine if this was a Chinese operated cargo ship.” ![ever given](https://zifangu.github.io/religion-of-the-world/images/canal.jpg)

## Discussion

Neither of the pictures I have with the celebrity or actor is singles — pictures of just me and the person. Going to classes every day, I was used to the fact that they go to my school. I treat them like classmates and friends rather than famous people. However, that is because of the environment I was in. Everyone in the school was used to it. No one is making a special deal out of it. When I left that environment, the fact of living with celebrities is no longer a common theme. Thus, everyone reacted with excitement and was surprised by that. By seeing others’ behavior and knowing that this class is a fair representation of Wofford’s community with majors across the discipline, I was able to see how unique my own background was.



As a Chinese national, I was very upset when internet users made unfounded claims that COVID-19 was manufactured by Chinese authorities. These claims still exist even after the WHO investigators concluded that the development of the virus was extremely unlikely to be artificially cultured. Regardless of the facts, many people fear that China will one day become powerful again, threatening other countries’ positions on the international level. This is made China a scapegoat. Because of the world’s point of view on China currently, and given my status in the US as an exchange student, my gut response was if China owned the cargo ship, the world would connect this to COVID-19 and construe a larger conspiracy. That immediate response came from my background. I realized that the context in which shaped me to be an easier target for something way out of anyone’s control. I compared to another concern that only a certain group of people worry about. Females are more hesitant to walk across parking lots at night, whereas males are much less concerned. Being shaped as women by nature simply put them into more harm’s way; being shaped from China, in today’s society, puts us in the center of blame.
