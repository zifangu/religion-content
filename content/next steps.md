As I mentioned in CENSURF 3, I wanted to adopt a partial living style of a Baha’i. Perhaps once a week, I would try to say a short prayer at noon. The time commitment of saying short prayers isn’t just the 30 seconds of praying. It requires me to periodically check time to make sure I haven’t missed it. Every time I do that though, my train of thoughts gets interrupted so it will take me more time to concentrate again. I know from the reading that Baha’is treat their faith seriously. Therefore, to mimic the behavior of a Baha’i, I can extrapolate the amount of commitment an actual practicing Baha’i would need and have a more personal understanding of the religion.

I will be attending graduate school in a much diverse city, in either Ann Arbor or Boston. If I live in Ann Arbor, I hope to visit the North American House of Worship outside of Chicago. In a school of 30,000 students, and under two hours away from Chicago, I am confident to find a Baha’i community on campus. This way, I hope to continue fighting against the stereotypes that Chinese exchange students only focus on academic achievements. I hope to show my community that I can be just as curious about religion and engage in difficult conversations about race and injustices just like Baha’is do.

At the beginning of the semester, we read some excerpts on people traveling to remote locations, most in developing countries with no tourist infrastructures. After earning my master’s degree, I hope to take a year or two to travel to similar countries. It wasn’t until reading Eck and Ruf had I realize that I have been a tourist for 20 years. Watching Youtube videos of how people hitch ride trains across the Sahara Desert was pretty appealing to me. There’s no first-class, no hot prepared meals. It would just be me and whatever materials each train car is carrying. I can further understand how tiny humans are compared to Earth, and how tiny Earth is in the universe.
